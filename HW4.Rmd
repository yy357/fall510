This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
Problem 1 
a
```{r}
a1<-c(1:20)
#create vector a1 from 1 to 20, assumed by 1
```
b
```{r}
a2<-c(20:1)
#create vector a2 from 20 to 1,by -1
```
c
```{r}
a3<-c(1:20,19:1)
#create a vector from 1 to 20, and add a vector from 19 to 1
```
d
```{r}
tmp<-c(4,6,3)
#create vector(4,6,3) and name it as tmp
```
e
```{r}
rep(tmp,10)
#repeat tmp 10 times, then there would be 10 occurances of 4
```
f
```{r}
rep(tmp,l=31)
#repeat tmp until the length comes up to 31
```
g
```{r}
 rep(tmp,times=c(10,20,30))
#repeat tmp element one by one,times 4 for 10 times, 6 for 20 times,3 for 30 time.
```

Problem 2
```{r}
x<-seq(3,6,0.1)
#create x from 3 to 6, by 0.1
exp(x)*cos(x)
#imput x into the calculation
```

Problem 3
a
```{r}
x<-seq(3,36,3)
#a sequence from 3 to 36, by 3 called x
y<-seq(1,34,3)
#a sequence from 3 to 36, by 3 called y
z<-c((.1^x)*(.2^y))
#input x,y into calculation of z
```
b
```{r}
(2^seq(1,25))/(seq(1,25))
#denominator from 1 to 25, assumes by 1;numerator is 2^1 to 25, by 1.devide them one by one
```

Problem 4
a
```{r}
tmp <- 10:100
#create 10 to 100 by 1 called tmp
sum(tmp^3+4*tmp^2)
#input tmp into equation to calculate summation
```
b
```{r}
tmp <- 1:25
#define sequence from 1 to 25 called tmp
sum((2^tmp)/tmp + 3^tmp/(tmp^2))
#input tmp into equation and calculate summation
```

Problem 5
a
```{r}
paste(c("label"),1:30,sep=" ")
#paste concatenate vectors after converting to characeter.Here, we use vector label from 1 to 30.The sep=" "means there is single space between label and number.
```
b
```{r}
paste(c("fn"),1:30,sep="")
#similar to previous problem, except we use sep="", then there is no space between fn and number
```

Problem 6
a
```{r}
set.seed(50)
xVec <- sample(0:999, 250, replace=T)
yVec <- sample(0:999, 250, replace=T)
a<-c(2:250)
#create vector a from 2 to 250 by 1,with the sample length 250
b<-c(1:249)
#create vector b from 1 to 249 by 1,with the sample length 250
yVec[a]-xVec[b]
#y2-x1 to y250-x249 one by one
```
b
```{r}
set.seed(50)
xVec <- sample(0:999, 250, replace=T)
yVec <- sample(0:999, 250, replace=T)
a<-c(2:250)
#create vector a from 2 to 250 by 1,with the sample length 250
b<-c(1:249)
#create vector b from 1 to 249 by 1,with the sample length 250
sin(yVec[b])/cos(xVec[a])
#sin1/cos2 to sin 249 to cos 250 one by one
```
c
```{r}
x<-c(1:248)
y<-c(2:249)
z<-c(3:250)
set.seed(50)
xVec <- sample(0:999, 250, replace=T)
v<-c(xVec[x]+(2*xVec[y])-xVec[z])
#x1+2x2-x3 to x248+2x249-x250 one by one
```
d
```{r}
i = (1:249)
#create i from 1 to 249 by 1
sum((exp(xVec)[i+1])/(xVec[i]+10))
#calculate summation
```

Problem 7
a
```{r}
yVec[yVec>600]
#find the numbers which bigger than 600
```
b
```{r}
which(yVec>600)
#which gives the TRUE position where yvec bigger than 600
```
c
```{r}
xVec[yVec>600]
#position of xVec have same position of yVec where yvec is bigger than 600
```
d
```{r}
sqrt(abs(xVec-mean(xVec)))
#calculate mean xvec first;using xVex minus mean and alsolute the answer,and sqrt them in the end
```
e
```{r}
sum( yVec>max(yVec)-200 )
#max()is a function to find maximum.We can find some value of yVec bigger than maximun-200. In the end, we can count the number by using sum.
```
f
```{r}
sum(xVec%%2==0)
#xVec%%2==o are the numbers that divisible by 2,we can use sum to count number.
```
g
```{r}
xVec[order(yVec)]
#order yVec increasingly,and then sort xVec.
```
h
```{r}
a<-seq(1, length(yVec), 3)
#create squence from 1 to length of yVec(250), by three
yVec[a]
#input a and find the value of y Vec
```

Problem 8
```{r}
a<-seq(2, 38, 2)
#create sequence from 2 to 38 by 2
b<-seq(3,39, 2)
#create sequence from 3 to 39 by 2
c<-a/b
#define c as a/b
m<-sum(1+cumprod(l))
#calculate answer by cumprod and to get the end solution
```
